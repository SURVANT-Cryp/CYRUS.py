# The commonsense acceptance of the city at face value belies the complex and often contradictory dynamics which are operating beneath the surface. CYRUS.py is an experimental intertextual poetics exploring notions of counterpublic identity, enclosure, hacker practice and terrorism in metropolises/netropolises. CYRUS.py combines cherry-picked output from two different python scripts: one program generates cut-up texts drawn from five writings—Fight Club, Invisible Man, Professionals of Hope: The Selected Writings of Subcomandante Marcos, Hackers (by Aase Berg), and The Warriors original movie script. In addition to the five writings mentioned, the program also draws from a Wikipedia list of local winds around the world. The other program generates spam-like strings of words/phrases flagged by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. All of the code can be located here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmjaerycd1d4mj3/pycode.zip?dl=0 . CYRUS.py also includes extracts from various sources exploring the aforementioned topics. ***

The one who works.', 'Cyrus says, “Get up.” Their voices come to me on the cold wind, saying, “Stop.” Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?', 'The barrel of the gun pressed against the back of my throat, Cyrus says, “We won’t really die.” The one who walks the night. But down below there is: Cunning, Cleverness, Foresight.', 'The one who is desert. The one who shares the blood and idea. Here, the silence no longer.', 'Then the smoke, smoke starts out of the broken windows. I say all this to assure you that it is incorrect to assume that, because I’m invisible and live in a hole, I am dead. The one who is person.', 'I am like the Cape Doctor.', 'You take enough blasting gelatin and wrap the foundation columns of anything, you can topple any building in the world.', 'Or when, even as just now I’ve tried to articulate exactly what I felt to be the truth. The one who is sand. And the horror of white fire still burned in the staring eyes.', 'But it is hardly heard. The horse is a shelter in which time stands still. Unless you can count.', 'You take a 98-percent concentration of fuming nitric acid and add the acid to three times that amount of sulfuric acid. I’m not killing myself, I yell. Here, the dark light, the time and feeling.', 'A lot of the space monkeys mix their nitro with cotton and add Epsom salts as a sulfate. The language. The gallop-handle, stomach pumps, the rushing G-force of rushing air.', 'I am like the Descuernacabras.', 'I am like the Diablo.', '“Your big death thing.” Vehicles shrieking past like faceless ghosts. Can the sleep of matter be made human?', 'Mix the nitro with sawdust, and you have a nice plastic explosive. They received a feeling of security. My belated appreciation of the crude joke that had kept me running, was not enough.', 'The man who is man. Here, the dark light, the time and feeling. If you are an animal here you are either alive or dead.', '“Because I’m your destiny.” The Lord of the net. Civilization means to love fiercely.', 'You take a 98-percent concentration of fuming nitric acid and add the acid to three times that amount of sulfuric acid. So I took to the cellar; I hibernated. The one who walks from the clouds.', 'The one who walks the night. The size. The horse is a shelter in which time stands still.', 'Oh, Cyrus, I hurt. Their voices come to me on the cold wind, saying, “Stop.” Heavy, darkened vehicles will create black sneak routes of asphalt leading straight into the earth’s heart.', 'Everything in my room is gone. Under and behind and inside everything I took for granted, something horrible has been growing. You have nitroglycerin.', 'This works, too. “We followed you,” Adalia.exe yells. The one who speaks flowers.', 'Those who, being first, are the last to appear and to perish... The one who has knowledge to govern. Inflated and hovering along foraging paths, the horse devours the world’s calm.', 'I say, lead the way. Cyrus and me at the edge of the roof, the gun in my mouth, I’m wondering how clean this gun is. The friction of slowly petrifying lava.', 'I have to do this. Vehicles shrieking past like faceless ghosts.

Forced Conclusion: Take over man’s violence, one can queer it, go down in the end.', 'With my tongue I can feel the silencer holes we drilled into the barrel of the gun.

Here, no longer shame for the color of our skin.', 'Cyrus says, “Get up.” Under and behind and inside everything I took for granted, something horrible has been growing. Wind Walked.', 'We walk the land. A glowing space-fly casts flitting silhouettes on a viscous surface. Nobody in this city could be safe outside his door.', 'The one who shares the idea. The man who is man. Either healthy and hearty or a bullet in your forehead.', 'I am neither dead nor in a state of suspended animation. The one who is the sea. 100,000 organized boppers.', 'So Cyrus and I are up on top of the Empire State Building with the gun stuck in my mouth. “Why should I know you?” My eye is the hand of violence.', 'I am like the Warm Braw.', 'Nothing explodes.

I ran away into the dark, laughing so hard I feared I might rupture myself.', 'Here, the building’s standing. Here, no longer shame for the color of our skin. A glowing space-fly casts flitting silhouettes on a viscous surface.', 'I am an invisible man. The true man. But the horse is also a war machine, the road a cloud, the asphalt slackens, time picks up.', 'Nothing explodes. The barrel of the gun tucked in my surviving cheek, I say, Cyrus, you mixed the nitro with paraffin, didn’t you. You might sneer at this, but I know now.', 'I’ve been here from the beginning.

I say all this to assure you that it is incorrect to assume that, because I’m invisible and live in a hole, I am dead. And it says more.', 'Second picture, the building will be at an eighty-degree angle. We have much time on our hands. Unless we say so.', 'The barrel of the gun pressed against the back of my throat, Cyrus says, “We really won’t die.” I use their service and pay them nothing at all, and they don’t know it. And miracles is the way things ought to be.', 'This is the world’s tallest building, and this high up the wind is always cold. One night I accidentally bumped into a man, and perhaps because of the near darkness he saw me and called me an insulting name. The one who speaks the right word.', 'To God, this looks like one man alone, holding a gun in his own mouth, but it’s Cyrus holding the gun, and it’s my life. And I pull the trigger. We came here to say “we are.”', 'Here, the building’s standing. But no more. Now don’t jump to the conclusion that because I call my home a “hole” it is damp and cold like a grave; there are cold holes and warm holes.', 'You drill the holes wrong and the gun will blow off your hand. This is about property as in ownership. The one who is father and older brother.', 'Mix the nitro with sawdust, and you have a nice plastic explosive. Sometimes it is best not to awaken them; there are few things in the world as dangerous as sleepwalkers. The friction of slowly petrifying lava.', 'He lay there, moaning on the asphalt; a man almost killed by a phantom. I remember that I am invisible and walk softly so as not to awaken the sleeping ones. The swift walker.', 'Seven minutes. Then somebody yells. They assume us to be defeated.', 'I say, lead the way. A cold planetary platform in the future tense through the woods. But the horse is also a war machine, the road a cloud, the asphalt slackens, time picks up.', 'The one who is mountain. My eye is the hand of violence. Unless we say so.', 'The one who shares the idea. Here, the dark light, the time and feeling. The question before us is, can you make it with a little simple arithmetic.', 'We, those who are the color of the earth. Inflated and hovering along foraging paths, the horse devours the world’s calm. But they can read glances through the back of their heads.', 'The one who is the sea. The surface is still smooth, the final dynamics have not yet been awakened, they will take effect later when speeding vehicles pull up the headwind’s disappearing routes of jet-stream velocity. Can the sleep of matter be made human?', 'Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you? The gallop-handle, stomach pumps, the rushing G-force of rushing air. And miracles is the way things ought to be.', 'I’m killing Cyrus. The one who sings. The one who is brother, sister.', 'Across the sky comes the whop, whop, whop of police helicopters. Even hibernations can be overdone, come to think of it. Mute.', 'That, perhaps, is a lesson for history, and I’ll leave such decisions to Cyrus and his ilk while I try belatedly to study the lesson of my own life. Here, the shout. Heavy, darkened vehicles will create black sneak routes of asphalt leading straight into the earth’s heart.', 'Under and behind and inside everything I took for granted, something horrible has been growing. It wouldn’t let me rest. The war, the weapons, the masculines.', 'I am like the Košava.', 'I know this because Cyrus knows this. I have also been called one thing and then another while no one really wished to hear what I called myself. The one who speaks flowers.', 'This is like a total epiphany moment for me. We have much time on our hands. We take over one borough at a time, secure our territory.', 'Once you get used to it, reality is as irresistible as a club, and I was clubbed into the cellar before I caught the hint. The animals have no mirrors. We could run the whole place, nothing would move without us allowing it to happen.', 'Nothing explodes. The one who is person. Instead metallic fatigue will gradually overtake him.', 'Look over the edge. You can topple anything. The problem in the past has been the man turning us on one another.', 'Adalia.exe is coming toward me, just me because Cyrus is gone. Perhaps that’s the way it had to be; I don’t know. I don’t fuck much with the past, but I fuck plenty with the future...And the future is ours if you can count.', 'In my presence they could talk and agree with themselves, the world was nailed down, and they loved it. We are the mirror for seeing ourselves and for being ourselves. Civilization means to love fiercely.', 'I know this because Cyrus knows this. “You see me?” I said, watching him tensely. A cold planetary platform in the future tense through the woods.', 'We walk the land. The surface is still smooth, the final dynamics have not yet been awakened, they will take effect later when speeding vehicles pull up the headwind’s disappearing routes of jet-stream velocity. My eye is the hand of violence.', 'And I stopped the blade, slicing the air as I pushed him away, letting him fall back to the street. Then I was amused. The warrior and the guardian.', 'You drill the holes wrong and the gun will blow off your hand. It’s so quiet this high up, the feeling you get is that you’re one of those space monkeys. The turf is ours by right because it’s our turn.', '“This is our world, now, our world,” Cyrus says, “and those ancient people are dead.” We came here to give ourselves a name. The one who is painted in color.', 'It is sometimes advantageous to be unseen, although it is most often rather wearing on the nerves. The point now is that I found a home -- or a hole in the ground, as you will. The one who walks the fog.', 'A lot of folks mix their nitro with cotton and add Epsom salts as a sulfate. One hundred and ninety-one floors up, you look over the edge of the roof and the street below is mottled with a shag carpet of people, standing, looking up. A hundred thousand.', 'This lets the gas escape and slows the bullet to below the speed of sound. I am neither dead nor in a state of suspended animation. The one who is person.', '(Beware of those who speak of the spiral of history; they are preparing a boomerang. Keep a steel helmet handy.) The one who works. ONE GANG COULD RUN THIS CITY.', 'The swift walker. The one who has word. Indigenous Brother, Sister: Non-indigenous Brother, Sister: We are here to say we are here.', 'They’re saying, “Wait.” Here, no longer shame for the color of our skin. We take over one borough at a time, secure our territory.', 'I am like the Washoe Zephyr.', 'I am like the Witch of November.', 'I am like the Roaring Forties.',
