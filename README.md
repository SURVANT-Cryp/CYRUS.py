# CYRUS.py

The commonsense acceptance of the city at face value belies the complex and often contradictory dynamics which are operating beneath the surface. CYRUS.py is an experimental intertextual poetics exploring notions of counterpublic identity, enclosure, hacker practice and terrorism in metropolises/netropolises. CYRUS.py combines cherry-picked output from two different python scripts: one program generates cut-up texts drawn from five writingsâ€”Fight Club, Invisible Man, Professionals of Hope: The Selected Writings of Subcomandante Marcos, Hackers (by Aase Berg), and The Warriors original movie script. In addition to the five writings mentioned, the program also draws textual material from a Wikipedia list of local winds around the world. The other program generates spam-like strings of words/phrases flagged by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. All of the code can be located here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmjaerycd1d4mj3/pycode.zip?dl=0. CYRUS.py also includes extracts from various sources exploring the aforementioned topics.
