# CYRUS.py 

The commonsense acceptance of the city at face value belies the complex and often contradictory dynamics which are operating beneath the surface. <i>CYRUS.py</i> is an experimental intertextual poetics + research tool exploring notions of counterpublic identity, enclosure, hacker practice and terrorism, and the relationship between language and the city. <i>CYRUS.py</i> combines cherry-picked output from a cut-up generator (also written in Python) with extracts from various web sources exploring the aforementioned topics. The cut-up generator outputs cut-up texts drawn from five writings, all dealing with transgressive groups—<i>Fight Club</i>, <i>Invisible Man</i>, <i>Professionals of Hope: The Selected Writings of Subcomandante Marcos</i>, <i>Hackers</i> (by Aase Berg), and <i>The Warriors</i> original movie script. I have changed some names and places of the original writings to help develop a more unified narrative. The form of <i>CYRUS.py</i> owes a great deal to the practices and methodologies of the Dadaists, William S. Burroughs, John Cage, and other aleatory operation practitioners, but also, the practice of flânerie in all its incarnations.<br>

In his 1863 essay, “The Painter of Modern Life,” poet Charles Baudelaire identified a new metropolitan figure, the <i>flâneur</i>—a roaming “passionate spectator” of the streets and shopping arcades of nineteenth-century Paris:<br>

“The crowd is his element, as the air is that of birds and water of fishes. His passion and his profession are to become one flesh with the crowd. For the perfect flâneur, for the passionate spectator, it is an immense joy to set up house in the heart of the multitude, amid the ebb and flow of movement, in the midst of the fugitive and the infinite. To be away from home and yet to feel oneself everywhere at home; to see the world, to be at the centre of the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world—impartial natures which the tongue can but clumsily define. The spectator is a prince who everywhere rejoices in his incognito. The lover of life makes the whole world his family, just like the lover of the fair sex who builds up his family from all the beautiful women that he has ever found, or that are or are not—to be found; or the lover of pictures who lives in a magical society of dreams painted on canvas. Thus the lover of universal life enters into the crowd as though it were an immense reservoir of electrical energy. Or we might liken him to a mirror as vast as the crowd itself; or to a kaleidoscope gifted with consciousness, responding to each one of its movements and reproducing the multiplicity of life and the flickering grace of all the elements of life.” (1)

Baudelaire’s gendered male flâneur is the consummate aesthete-wanderer of the city; he is a mythic character who empirically collects social artifacts and experiences of metropolitan life. Chris Jenks states the flâneur “possesses a power, it walks at will, freely and seemingly without purpose, but simultaneously with an inquisitive wonder and an infinite capacity to absorb the activities of the collective—often formulated as ‘the crowd.’” (2) The flâneur is a somewhat paradoxical persona. This spectator is a paragon of metropolitan living in certain ways, an individual profoundly captivated by the heterogeneous movement of the city. Unlike a tourist, he knows how to navigate through the city to unlock its secrets, even finding peculiar beauty in its detritus. Although the flâneur is surrounded by other urban dwellers he only superficially interacts with them. He of course needs the crowd, after all, this frenetic body is in large part what makes the cityscape so intoxicating for him. But somehow he is distinct from the crowd. Is the flâneur anti-social? Voyeuristic? Is the flâneur even real? Baudelaire modeled the flâneur archetype after a real person, artist Constantin Guys, but also states that aspects of the persona are “pure poetic hypothesis, conjecture, a labor of the imagination.” (Baudelaire) Baudelaire highlighted other urban figures in his writings as well; the prostitute and rag-picker figure prominently in “The Painter of Modern Life.” James Donald points out that “in these marginal, despised figures, living on their wits and for reading the signs of the city rightly could be a matter of life or death, Baudelaire saw an image of the modern poet’s social interaction and role.” (3) This statement underscores a salient fact about Baudelaire’s flâneur; the figure is not a passive observer—he learns from what and who he views. The flâneur listens to the pulse of the city’s center, but also, puts an ear to the margins. 

Cultural critic Walter Benjamin attempted to recreate Baudelaire’s mythical Paris, the birthplace of the flâneur. His colossal study of nineteenth century Paris, <i>The Arcades Project</i>, adds depth to Baudelaire’s flâneur character and examines why this peripatetic figure largely vanishes from the urban landscape towards the end of the nineteenth century. <i>The Arcades Project</i> is a master work of annotation made up of historical tidbits and fragments; a montage of quotations from, and reflections on, hundreds and hundreds of sources. In essence, a flâneuric investigation of nineteenth-century life through literature. Through this “sculptural” process of collecting and then annotating, a visage of nineteenth-century Paris emerges.<br>

In <i>CYRUS.py</i>, I utilize a similar textual methodology to Benjamin’s in <i>The Arcades Project</i>—copying interesting anecdotes about urban life (IRL + URL), particulalry, extracts that relate to counterpublics, transgressive action, and existential threats to the city.<br>
