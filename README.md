# cyrus.py GPDF278

The commonsense acceptance of the city at face value belies the complex and often contradictory dynamics which are operating beneath the surface. <i>cyrus.py</i> is an experimental intertextual poetics + research tool that explores counterpublic identity, hacking, terrorism, and the relationship between walking, language, and the city.

<i>cyrus.py</i> combines extracts from an eclectic array of sources exploring the above-mentioned topics with cherry-picked output from another cut-up generator I created. This earlier program (also written in Python) outputs cut-ups of five writings: <i>Fight Club</i>, <i>Invisible Man</i>, <i>Professionals of Hope: The Selected Writings of Subcomandante Marcos</i>, <i>Hackers</i> (by Aase Berg), and <i>The Warriors</i> original movie script. I changed some names and places of the original writings to help develop a more unified narrative. The form of <i>cyrus.py</i> owes a great deal to the practices of Dadaism, Surrealism, Walter Benjamin, John Cage, and fl√¢nerie in all its incarnations.
