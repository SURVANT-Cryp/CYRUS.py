# CYRUS.py

The commonsense acceptance of the city at face value belies the complex and often contradictory dynamics which are operating beneath the surface. CYRUS.py is an experimental intertextual poetics exploring notions of counterpublic identity, enclosure, hacker practice and terrorism in metropolises/netropolises. CYRUS.py combines cherry-picked output from two different python scripts: one program generates cut-up texts drawn from five writings—Fight Club, Invisible Man, Professionals of Hope: The Selected Writings of Subcomandante Marcos, Hackers (by Aase Berg), and The Warriors original movie script. In addition to the five writings mentioned, the program also draws textual material from a Wikipedia list of local winds around the world. The other program generates spam-like strings of words/phrases flagged by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. All of the code can be located here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmjaerycd1d4mj3/pycode.zip?dl=0. CYRUS.py also includes extracts from various sources exploring the aforementioned topics.


“With an unprecedented amount of available text, our problem is not needing to write more of it; instead, we must learn to negotiate the vast quantity that exists. How I make my way through this thicket of information—how I manage it, parse it, organize and distribute it—is what distinguishes my writing from yours.”

“Losing your way, or drifting, is part and parcel of the reading experience as its come to us in its finalized form, regardless of whether or not Benjamin’s book is ‘unfinished.’”
