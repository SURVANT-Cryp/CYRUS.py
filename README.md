# cyrus.py 

The commonsense acceptance of the city at face value belies the complex and often contradictory dynamics which are operating beneath the surface. cyrus.py is an experimental intertextual poetics + research tool exploring notions of counterpublic identity, enclosure, hacker practice and terrorism, and the relationship between language and the city. cyrus.py combines cherry-picked output from a cut-up generator (also written in Python) with extracts from a variety of sources exploring the aforementioned topics. The cut-up generator outputs cut-up texts drawn from five writings: Fight Club, Invisible Man, Professionals of Hope: The Selected Writings of Subcomandante Marcos, Hackers (by Aase Berg), and “The Warriors” original movie script. I have changed some names and places of the original writings to help develop a more unified narrative. The form of cyrus.py owes a great deal to the practices of Dadaism, Surrealism, Walter Benjamin, John Cage, and flânerie in all its incarnations.

I am sharing this project on GitHub in the spirit of distribution and DIWO culture.
